# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently, only the latest release of each major and minor version series is considered supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I develop this project alone, in my spare time. I try to respond to security issues whenever possible, but I cannot guarantee immediate attention or fixes.

If you discover a security vulnerability:

- **Email:** `report@vpl.tothattila05.hu`
- **Process:** Send a clear description of the issue and steps to reproduce it.
- **Confidentiality:** Please avoid publicly disclosing the vulnerability until it has been addressed.

Thank you for understanding and helping to keep the project secure.
